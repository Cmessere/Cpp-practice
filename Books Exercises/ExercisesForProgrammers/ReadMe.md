# Welcome
This is a repo for the exercises from Brian Hogan's book "Exercises for Programmers".

You can check the git history of each exercise to see the different implementations!

## Breakdown
Every exercise has been completed with all "constraints" and "challenges" whenever possible.

Since some exercises or specific challenges needed a graphic representation or web based implementation I opted to avoid these cases.

As an added constraint, I tried to avoid classes and only used data structures.

52/57 completed.
